# How to Use Python To Create A Beautiful Web Calendar

> # A Web Calendar built with Python

At work I usually use [PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript](github.com/garthhumphreys) to build any bits of functionality but sometimes it can take quite awhile to get the what I want working.

So recently, I’ve found it really nice to use [Python](www.python.org) in my workflow to “glue” together certain aspects of a project.

For example I found it easier to create a employee pay day calendar with Python vs creating it in [PHP](www.php.net). Not only was it fun to build but I’m left with more time to explore extending my initial idea.
